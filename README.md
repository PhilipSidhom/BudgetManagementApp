# Budget Management App

The Budget Management App, developed in C#, is designed to assist users in effectively managing their expenses. It offers a range of functionalities to organize and track expenses conveniently.

## Overview

Upon launching the app, users are greeted by the File Finder screen, presenting two options: creating a new database file or selecting an existing one. If creating a new file, a prompt will ask for the file name and location. Selecting an existing file opens a file explorer for the user to choose the desired file. From there, they can utilize the functionalities below.

### Adding Expenses

Using the "Add Expense" button opens a window where users can input expense details. Each expense includes category, date, description, amount, and whether it's credit or not. The main window continuously updates to display all added expenses and calculates the total cost of expenses.

### Expense Categories

Users can create new expense categories, which are utilized when adding new expenses. These categories aid in organizing and filtering expenses effectively.

### Updating and Editing Expenses

The app features an "Update Expense" window enabling users to modify and edit existing expenses for accuracy and relevance.

### Search and Filtering

Users can easily search through expenses and apply filters by category, month, or date, simplifying navigation and analysis of expenses.
